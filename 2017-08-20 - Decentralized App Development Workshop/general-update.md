Hello everyone.  A couple of updates to mention.
1. I'll be moving out the current Decentralized App Development Workshops out.  These will be developer-focused,
application building sessions.  Look for an update coming soon.
2. Larry Salibra, who spoke at our inagural meeting recently release a To-Do app video.  Its a good walkthrough
of creating a simple blockstack application using decentralized sign-in and storage.
