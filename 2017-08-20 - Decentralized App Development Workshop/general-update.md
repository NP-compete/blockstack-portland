Hello everyone.  A couple of updates to mention.
1. I'll be moving out the current Decentralized App Development Workshops out.  These will be developer-focused,
application building sessions.  Look for an update coming soon.
2. The Blockstack Summit videos have been released!  Some great videos here around blockstack and blockchain in general, I encourage you to take a look.  https://blockstack.org/summit2017
2. Larry Salibra, who spoke at our inagural meeting recently release a To-Do app video.  Its a good walkthrough
of creating a simple blockstack application using decentralized sign-in and storage.  Build your own decentralized ToDo app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyvg-h0obFw
