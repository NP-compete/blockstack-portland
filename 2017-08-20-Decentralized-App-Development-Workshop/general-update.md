Hello everyone. There's a lot going on recently, and there are a couple of changes to mention.

I'll be moving out the current Decentralized App Development Workshops out. We're still working on logistics.  These will be developer-focused, application building sessions. Look for an update coming soon.
The BlockStack Summit videos have been released! Some great videos here around BlockStack and block-chain in general, I encourage you to take a look. https://blockstack.org/summit2017
BlockStack announce their token sale at BlockStack Summit.  Don't call it an ICO.  To stay informed about the sale, you can sign up here: https://blockstack.org/token
Larry Salibra, who spoke at our inaugural meeting, recently release a To-Do app tutorial. Its a good walk-through of creating a simple BlockStack application using decentralized sign-in and storage. Build your own decentralized To-Do app! app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyvg-h0obFw
I'll be speaking at Portland Enterprise Blockchain meetup this Tuesday, Aug 15. (https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Enterprise-Blockchain-Meetup/events/242191673/)
Again, look for an update to our development workshop soon.

Thanks,

Dan
