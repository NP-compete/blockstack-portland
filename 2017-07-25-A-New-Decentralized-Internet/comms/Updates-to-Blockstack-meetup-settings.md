Hello everyone, just a couple of administrative and content updates.

First, I enabled the moderated mailing list functionality.  This means if you hit "Reply", your reply will go to everyone on the mailing list.

Second, I've added a couple of community links to the site:

https://twitter.com/BlockstackOrg (link) - the official Blockstack twitter account
http://chat.blockstack.org/ (link) - signup for the official Blockstack slack channel
Finally, on the content side, I wanted to call your attention to Blockstack Academy (link) on YouTube.

Blockstack Academy is a great resource with bite-sized content that can give you some context around the need for a Decentralized Internet, as well as some high-level "how it works" videos.

Thanks!

Dan
