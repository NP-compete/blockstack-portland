Hello, Blockstackers!  This morning Blockstack Summit 2017 was announced.  It will be held at the Computer History 
Museum in Mountainview.  There are still Early Bird tickets available as of this writing, and the speaker line-up 
looks great, with several notable blockchain industry leaders.  I encourage you to take a look and buy your 
tickets early, if you're interested.

Dan
