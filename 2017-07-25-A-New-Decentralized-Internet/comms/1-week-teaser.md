Good morning everyone.  Less than a week to go until our inaugural meetup.  Larry Salibra (@larrysalibra), Blockstack core
developer will be presenting an introduction to the Open Source Blockstack project and then leading us through building an
first application.  

In my opinion, one of the great things about the approach that Blockstack has taken is that it is largely
programming language agnostic.  Auth libraries are available for Python and Ruby.  There is a todo app written
[in Javascript and a [music player](http://ongakuryoho.com/) written in Elm, Node, and Haskell.
