Good morning everyone.  Less than a week to go until our inaugural meetup.  [Larry Salibra](https://twitter.com/larrysalibra), Blockstack core developer will be presenting an introduction to the open source Blockstack project and then leading us through building our first application.  

One of the great things about the approach that Blockstack has taken is that it is largely
programming language agnostic.  Auth libraries are available for [Python](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-auth-python) and [Ruby](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-ruby).  There is a [todo app](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-todos) written
in Javascript and a [music player](http://ongakuryoho.com/) written in Elm, Node, and Haskell.  All of this is still developer-release-level code, but the possibilities are out there.

I'm planning two follow-up app building workshops in August.  More details on those forthcoming.  We'll be making a big announcement Tuesday night as well, so dont miss it.

Blockstack Browser 0.11.1 (developer alpha) is out.  Download it and kick the tires if you get a chance.  Binary for Mac is [here](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-browser/releases) and build instructions for Mac and Linux are [here](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-browser).

See you Tuesday.

Dan
