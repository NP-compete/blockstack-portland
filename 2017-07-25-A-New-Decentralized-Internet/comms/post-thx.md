Thank you to everyone who attended our initial meetup Tuesday night.  We had a good turnout, and Larry Salibra 
gave an informative talk.  We'll provide a link to that soon.  In addition to the core presentation we had a good
discusson on related items like how bitcoin transactions work, distributed storage (ipfs, SIA), how DHT and Atlas work, 
search challenges with decentralized applications, and architecture of decentralized applications.  The Portland area 
has a very vibrant crypto ecosystem from grassroots community to businesses based here.

I'm planning an decentralized app building workshop for August.  We may also just set up a couple of social-type events
because the discussion Tuesday night was great.  I'm interested in everyone's feedback, whether you were able to attend
Tuesday night or not, and so look for a survey in the next couple of days.

Dan
