I've updated this Meetup.  I'm happy to announce that Larry Salibra, Blockstack core developer will be guiding our initial meeting.  He will be stopping here, in Portland, on his way to San Francisco for Blockstack Summit 2017.  If you will not be attending the summit, this would be a good chance to speak to one Blockstack's main contributors.
