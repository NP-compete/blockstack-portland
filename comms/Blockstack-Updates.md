Hello, Blockstackers. A couple of quick updates...

Blockstack Summit 2017 - Extended Ticket Sales
The initially available tickets have sold out! But Blockstack will be opening up an 
extended ticket sale beginning tomorrow, June 27, at noon. The speaker lineup looks great, 
and it should be a great opportunity to speak directly to people directly involved in the Blockstack ecosystem. 
Hope to see you there.  https://www.eventbrite.com/e/blockstack-summit-2017-tickets-35385366584?aff=es2
