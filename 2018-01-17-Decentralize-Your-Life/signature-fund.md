Greetings Blockstackers.

Have you heard about the Blockstack Signature Fund?

"The Signature Fund for Blockstack is a $25M fund aimed at growing an ecosystem of decentralized applications on Blockstack." - [Blockstack Signature Fund](https://blockstack.org/funding)

The first signature bounty was completed in December.  The developers of the winning application won $25,000.  You can find the app here: [Coins](http://use.coinsapp.co/)

There are currently two bounty competitions scheduled to end February 16:

[Team Messaging](https://groupmessage.eventbrite.com/) - $25,000

[Encrypted & Decentralized P2P Messaging](https://p2pmessage.eventbrite.com/) - $25,000

These bounties are open to everyone.  And you do not need to be a developer to participate.  There are potentially teams looking for designers, product managers, whatever.

I encourage you to take a look.

Dan
